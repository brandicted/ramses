RAML Configuration
==================

You can read the full RAML specs `here <http://raml.org/spec.html>`_.


Authentication
--------------

In order to enable authentication, add the ``auth`` parameter to your .ini file:

.. code-block:: ini

    auth = true

In the root section of your RAML file, you can add a ``securitySchemes``, define the ``x_ticket_auth`` method and list it in your root-level ``securedBy``. This will enable cookie-based authentication.

.. code-block:: yaml

    securitySchemes:
        - x_ticket_auth:
            description: Standard Pyramid Auth Ticket policy
            type: x-Ticket
            settings:
                secret: auth_tkt_secret
                hashalg: sha512
                cookie_name: ramses_auth_tkt
                http_only: 'true'
    securedBy: [x_ticket_auth]

A few convenience routes will be automatically added:

* POST ``/auth/register``: register a new user
* POST ``/auth/login``: login an existing user
* GET ``/auth/logout``: logout currently logged-in user
* GET ``/users/self``: returns currently logged-in user


ACLs
----

In your ``securitySchemes``, you can add as many ACLs as you need. Then you can reference these ACLs in your resource's ``securedBy``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    securitySchemes:
        (...)
        - read_only_users:
            description: ACL that allows authenticated users to read
            type: x-ACL
            settings:
                collection: |
                    allow admin all
                    allow authenticated view
                item: |
                    allow admin all
                    allow authenticated view
    (...)
    /items:
        securedBy: [read_only_users]


Enabling HTTP Methods
---------------------

Listing an HTTP method in your resource definition is all it takes to enable such method.

.. code-block:: yaml

    /items:
        (...)
        post:
            description: Create an item
        get:
            description: Get multiple items
        patch:
            description: Update multiple items
        delete:
            description: delete multiple items

        /{id}:
            displayName: One item
            get:
                description: Get a particular item
            delete:
                description: Delete a particular item
            patch:
                description: Update a particular item


You can link your schema definition for each resource by adding it to the ``post`` section.

.. code-block:: yaml

    /items:
        (...)
        post:
            (...)
            body:
                application/json:
                    schema: !include schemas/items.json


Generated models naming
-----------------------

As ramses automatically generates DB models from RAML routes' paths it may be useful to know how model corresponding to particular RAML route will be called.

Here are few examples that will make models naming clear:

.. code-block:: yaml

    /users -> User
    /alienusers -> Alienusers
    /alien-users -> AlienUser


Knowing what names generates models have is required when trying to access those models from ramses app code or other python code.
